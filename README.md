# Safety-Phone-Application-Investor-Pitch-and-Data-Analysis

Entrepreneurship in Computing & Data Analysis Project

## Description

Invented a phone application that acts as a peer protection network in order to keep students safe by sharing data and statistics from our database of reports to depict what locations have a high level of crimes occurring and what type of crimes are occurring, maintaining privacy with an anonymous reporting system, and educating users with access to meaningful resources. Created and presented an investor pitch with financial models and calculations, a working Figma representation of the application, a software patent, user stories/personas, researched the competition and the market, questionnaires for our potetnial user audience, and data analysis and graphical represenation of the questionnaires.

## Elevator Pitch

Buddies is a mobile app that educates and combats sexual assault on university campuses. It creates a peer-to-peer network of safety, allows students to maintain their privacy with anonymous reporting, and educates students with access to meaningful resources. Universities can have access to this app to fulfill their Clery Act requirements by paying on average less than $1 per student per year.
